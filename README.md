# Climate-Trend-Visualization

Analyzed historical climate data (1950â€“2020) for Hawaii, Arizona, and Washington to explore temperature trends. Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. Findings highlight regional differences in warming patterns and seasonal variations.

Skills: Data preprocessing, statistical analysis, trend visualization, Python programming.
